# ascii_ttrpg
A TTRPG Game using ASCII Roguelike principles

This is a learning experience for both roguelike development and Rust as a programming
language. It will be based off of the roguelike tutorial found at
http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/ , and will leverage the bracket-lib
crate.
